0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. It is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help to:

~ Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances.
~ Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
~ Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel.
~ Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
~ Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.

Features of the Project:
# create an object for example create user
# do operations on the object for example count
# update attributes
# retrieve an object
# destroy object
